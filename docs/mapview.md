| `cacheEnabled`                    | `Boolean`                            | `false`      | If `true` map will be cached and displayed as an image instead of being interactable, for performance usage. **Note:** Apple Maps only                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

If you use this, the `region` property is ignored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `compassOffset`                   | `Point`                              |              | If set, changes the position of the compass. **Note:** iOS Maps only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

See [README](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps#customizing-the-map-style) for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `followsUserLocation`             | `Boolean`                            | `false`      | If `true` the map will focus on the user's location. This only works if `showsUserLocation` is true and the user has shared their location. **Note**: Apple Maps only.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `initialCamera`                   | `Camera`                             |              | Like `initialRegion`, use this prop instead of `camera` only if you don't want to control the viewport of the map besides the initial camera setting.<br/><br/> Changing this prop after the component has mounted will not result in a region change.<br/><br/> This is similar to the `initialValue` prop of a text input.                                       |
| `initialRegion`                   | `Region`                             |              | The initial region to be displayed by the map. Use this prop instead of `region` only if you don't want to control the viewport of the map besides the initial region.<br/><br/> Changing this prop after the component has mounted will not result in a region change.<br/><br/> This is similar to the `initialValue` prop of a text input.                      |
| `isAccessibilityElement`          | `Boolean`                            | `false`      | Determines whether the MapView captures VoiceOver touches or forwards them to children. When `true`, map markers are not visible to VoiceOver. **Note:** iOS Maps only.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `kmlSrc`                          | `string`                             |              | The URL from KML file. **Note:** Google Maps and Markers only (either Android or iOS with `PROVIDER_GOOGLE`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `legalLabelInsets`                | `EdgeInsets`                         |              | If set, changes the position of the "Legal" label link from the OS default. **Note:** iOS only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `loadingBackgroundColor`          | `Color`                              | `#FFFFFF`    | Sets loading background color, default to `#FFFFFF`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Useful when map elements/markers are obscured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Events

To access event data, you will need to use `e.nativeEvent`. For example, `onPress={e => console.log(e.nativeEvent)}` will log the entire event object to your console.

## Types

```
type Region {
  latitude: Number,
  longitude: Number,
  latitudeDelta: Number,
  longitudeDelta: Number,
}
```

```
type Camera = {
    center: {
       latitude: number,
       longitude: number,
   },
   pitch: number,
   heading: number,

   // Only on iOS MapKit, in meters. The property is ignored by Google Maps.
   altitude: number,

   // Only when using Google Maps.
   zoom: number
}
```

Latitude and longitude are self explanatory while latitudeDelta and longitudeDelta may not.
On the [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/reference/mapkit/mkcoordinatespan/1452417-latitudedelta) website this is how the "latitudeDelta" property is explained:

> The amount of north-to-south distance (measured in degrees) to display on the map. Unlike longitudinal distances, which vary based on the latitude, one degree of latitude is always approximately 111 kilometers (69 miles).

If this is not enough, you can find a [visual explanation on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36685372/how-to-zoom-in-out-in-react-native-map/36688156#36688156).

Note that when using the `Camera`, MapKit on iOS and Google Maps differ in how the height is specified. For a cross-platform app, it is necessary
to specify both the zoom level and the altitude separately.

```
type LatLng {
  latitude: Number,
  longitude: Number,
}
```

```
type Location {
  latitude: Number,
  longitude: Number,
  altitude: Number,
  timestamp: Number, //Milliseconds since Unix epoch
  accuracy: Number,
  altitudeAccuracy: Number,
  speed: Number,
}
```

```
type Point {
  x: Number,
  y: Number,
}
```

```
type Frame {
  x: Number,
  y: Number,
  width: Number,
  height: Number,
}
```

```
enum MapType : String {
  "standard",
  "satellite",
  "hybrid",
  "terrain" //Android only
}
```

```
type EdgePadding {
  top: Number,
  right: Number,
  bottom: Number,
  left: Number
}
```

```
type EdgeInsets {
  top: Number,
  left: Number,
  bottom: Number,
  right: Number
}
```

```
type Marker {
  id: String,
  coordinate: LatLng,
  title: String,
  description: String
}
```

```
type KmlContainer {
  markers: [Marker]
}
```

```
type IndoorBuilding {
  underground: boolean,
  activeLevelIndex: Number,
  levels: Array<IndoorLevel>,
}
```

```
type IndoorLevel {
  index: Number,
  name: String,
  shortName: String,
}
```

```
type Address {
  name: String,
